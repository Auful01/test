                <h4>Programmer</h4>
                <p style="color: black;">A computer programmer creates the code for software applications and operating systems. After a
                    software developer designs a computer program, the programmer writes code that converts that
                    design into a set of instructions a computer can follow. They test the program to look for
                    errors and then rewrite it until it is error-free. The programmer continues to evaluate programs
                    that are in use, making updates and adjustments as needed.
